    `My name is Akmuhammet Ashyralyyev but you can call me muhammed, akmami, mami, or even aki, ak (due to obvious reasons).
    I was born in Ashgabat, the capital of Turkmenistan, in 1999. 
    I went to school no. 51 until we moved to Turkey, Istanbul in 2010. 
    For 8 years, I have completed my middle school and high school education there. During that time, I have attended many math competitions and won several achievements (thanks to my dad).`,
    `In 2018, I graduated from Ugur Okulllari and got accepted from Bilkent University with a %100 scholarship.
    I have learnt many things and developed many skills over 4 years. The online courses that I have completed can be found in the section Courses.
    Apart from learning, I have tried to put that knowledge into practice. Specifically on courses' projects. The examples can be found on my GitHub repos.
    I have also got a chance to have a job experience which 2 of them are internship.`,
    `Lastly, I like travelling, feasting :) and watching movies/series. On the other hand, I am really rigorous (mostly in all aspects of my life). 
    Sometimes it's a blessing and sometimes its curse :'). But I always find a way to transfer it into something to obtain good results.`
